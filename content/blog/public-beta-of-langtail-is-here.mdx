Introducing Langtail, a collaborative platform designed to streamline the development, testing, and deployment of generative AI models. Born from firsthand experience with the challenges of building AI applications, Langtail aims to simplify the process, save valuable time, and enhance team collaboration. Let's dive into the details of our public beta and see how Langtail can help you.

## The Journey to Langtail

Langtail emerged from challenges while developing an AI assistant. We know first-hand how difficult it can be to build a chatbot that can handle real-world scenarios and how much time it takes to get it right. And we're not alone in this struggle, as many companies we talked to face similar challenges when building apps with LLMs and other generative AI models.

The lack of tools for collaborating on prompts, debugging, and evaluating capabilities made the process manual and time-consuming. There was urgent need for a more streamlined approach, and so, the idea for Langtail was born, aiming to become an all-in-one platform for generative AI models while also providing the necessary tooling for collaboration, testing, analytics, and more.

The current version of Langtail is just the beginning, and of course, it's not yet the fully-fledged platform we envision. However, even in its early stages, the public beta is useful and is already serving a select group of partners.

## What Can You Achieve with Langtail's Public Beta?

### Collaborative Workspace

Invite your team to collaborate in one space. Work together on prompts, create evaluation tests, and much more, enhancing your teamwork and efficiency.

## What's Next for Langtail?

We're proud of where Langtail stands today, but we're even more excited about where it's going. Here's a sneak peek of what's cooking in our development kitchen:

- **Support for More LLM Providers**: We're continuously expanding our horizons to integrate more LLM providers into Langtail. Anthropic is next on our list, and we're actively working to bring it into our fold.

- **Live Data Evaluation Tests**: We're developing a feature that allows you to run evaluation tests on live data. This real-time feedback mechanism will instantly alert you if your LLM is behaving differently than expected, enabling you to take immediate corrective action.

- **Per API Key Budget and Rate Limiting**: To provide more control over your usage, we're introducing per API key budgeting and rate limiting. This will allow you to manage your resource consumption more effectively and prevent any unwelcome surprises.

However, our future plans aren't just about us or the features we think are cool. We're building Langtail for you, the developers who use it every day. So, we want to hear from you. What features would make your life easier? How can we better serve your needs? Your feedback, ideas, and suggestions are not just welcome—they're vital to making Langtail the best it can be.
